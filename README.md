# Weather-App

## Description

- I am currently working on a page that loads as soon as your browser starts up. One of the features is this weather app I created using javascript.
- This weather app has a couple different functionalities. First, after you choose a city to find the weather data of, it will display the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions of the next 5 days including the current day. The app also shows the uv index of the current day, aswell as change colors per danger level of the uv index. (Green for low, yellow for moderate, and red for high). The last 5 cities searched are saved and displayed in a panel on the left. When you click on a city name, it brings up the data for that city.
- By making this app I learned how to pull data from a server side api, aswell as use local storage to save an array of items.
